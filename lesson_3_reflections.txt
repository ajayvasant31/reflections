 1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 
->  when your working on a project it's good to have a remote copy of your flies available so if the pc you are working on gets lost 
    or damaged you can simply get your files back from remote machine.other than that when you are working in a collaborative project 
     environment you have to share your work with others as well so rather than sending your code to each individuals you can make a 
     remote repository and share the link with others, so others can also access the code.
	 
2)	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

->	that way you can have control over what you really want to pull on your local repository. because in open projects many users post
	their version of the code and if you select to have git automatically update your local repository with remote repository then there's 
	some chance that you get wrong code downloaded into your local repository.

3)	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

->	fork can be simply explained as cloning repository on github. as you clone one repository from github to your local machine
	by using fork you can clone one github repository to your github account.
	
	cloning is copying a repository from github to your local machine or copying a repository from a local machine to a local machine.
	
	branches can be made on local machine or on github. branches helps to maintain different versions of your code.

4)	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

->	you have the idea about the latest commits on your remote repository even when you are not connected to internet. it helps to keep
	track of the most recent commit in offline mode.
