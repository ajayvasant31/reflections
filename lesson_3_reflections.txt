 1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 
->  when your working on a project it's good to have a remote copy of your flies available so if the pc you are working on gets lost 
    or damaged you can simply get your files back from remote machine.other than that when you are working in a collaborative project 
     environment you have to share your work with others as well so rather than sending your code to each individuals you can make a 
     remote repository and share the link with others, so others can also access the code.
